# matonen

The famous Worm-game (Mato peli in Finnish), but with a twist. Literally.

The "worm" is controlled by turning your device (phone, pad, or some laptops with positional hw) left
and right.

Currenlty in development (most propably indefinitely).

Controls are still under development, but <kbd>X</kbd> resets game and <kbd>space</kbd> is pause.

## Usage

### Development

todo...

# Play

Game starts immediatelly. Control your worm by turning your browser.
